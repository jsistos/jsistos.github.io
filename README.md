# Jesús Sistos Barrón

I am a first-year Ph.D. Student at the university of Georgia. Among my areas of interest are Topology and Differential Geometry. In the past, I did some work on enumerative combinatorics, which I will publish here soon.

In my free time, I enjoy playing boardgames or going for a bike ride (although I am by no means a cyclist).
